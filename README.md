# SmartTrolley
All of us have been shopping in supermarkets and malls. Most of the times we require a trolley to place our purchases. Every time we have to pull the trolley from rack to rack for collecting items and at the same time also do calculation of those items and need to compare it with our budget. After this procedure, comes the long process of waiting in queue for billing. So, to avoid all of these tedious tasks, we are introducing new concept that is “SMART TROLLEY FOR MEGA MALL”. In modern era, for automation of mall we are developing a microprocessor based SMART TROLLEY. The customer simply has to hold the barcode side of the product wrapper in front of barcode scanner. Then corresponding data regarding product will be sent to the server and a bill will be generated as well. The system will be placed in all the trolleys. As we put the products, the cost will get added to total bill. Thus the billing will be done in the trolley itself. Item name and its cost will be displayed on LCD.
# Thus, the project aims to save time waiting in the queue and this enhance the overall shopping experience.
